This Repository aims to practical use of Material UI to create amazing User Interfaces.

- In this repository, I have created a custom template of responsive Photo Album kind of App. The Source code can be used in any application.

- This also makes me practice on designing the WebApp using Material UI and to be honest I really fell in love with the library. How easily, we can start implementing logics without worrying much on the layouts.

- Few Points to remember from this project :-

1. In the Material UI Documentation -> 'Component' tab is the place where you can understand about the component looks and working
2. Where as, in 'Component API' you can check what are the props that can be explored to create your own designed web App

- Components covered in this project -

1. Typography :- Focused on the Font of the element
2. AppBar :- The Header section of the component
3. Card :- The images loaded in the main screen
4. CardActions :- What are the kind of Action you want to be implemented in your card
5. CardMedia :- The image loaded in each cards
6. CssBaseline :- It gives a basic CSS to the componenrt to the app by default from material UI
7. Grid :- Always responsive, and comnes in pair. One 'container' and another one is 'items'
8. Toolbar :- ToolBar doesn’t work independently as that of other Material-UI components, it works with the AppBar. The Toolbar component sets the properties of the children to make them horizontally aligned. The Toolbar component simply applies the normal CSS flex(display: ‘flex’), with vertical centering via alignItems: ‘center’,
9. Container :- Container for all the elements present in the App.
10. Button :- Butons used
11. CardContent :- All the contents present in cards

Happy Learning! :D
